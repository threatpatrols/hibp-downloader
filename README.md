This is a CLI tool to efficiently download a local copy of the pwned password hash data from the very awesome
[HIBP](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords) pwned passwords [api-endpoint](https://api.pwnedpasswords.com) using all the good bits;
multiprocessing, async-processes, local-caching, content-etags and http2-connection pooling to probably make things 
as fast as is Pythonly possible.

## Features
 - Download the full dataset in under 45 mins (generally CPU bound)
 - Easily resume interrupted `download` operations into a `--data-path` without re-clobbering api-source.
 - Only download hash-prefix content blocks when the source content has changed (via content ETAG values); making it 
   easy to periodically sync-up when needed.
 - Download and store acquired data gzip'd compressed to save on storage (and speed up queries!) 
 - Ability to directly `query` for compromised password values from the data in-place, without needing to decompress.
 - Query performance is efficient enough to attach a web-service with reasonable loads (ie don't waste resources by decompressing the dataset into a database for query!)
 - Ability to generate a single text file with in-order pwned password hash values, similar to [PwnedPasswordsDownloader](https://github.com/HaveIBeenPwned/PwnedPasswordsDownloader) from the HIBP team.
 - Per prefix file metadata in JSON format for easy data reuse by other tooling if required.

## Install

 - 918x requests per second to `api.pwnedpasswords.com`
 - Log sources are shorthand:
     - `lc`: 13616 from local-cache (lc) - request-responses handled locally without hitting the network. 
     - `et`: 3 etag-matched (et) - request-responses that confirmed our local data was up-to-date and did not require a new download.
     - `rc`: 1002958 from remote-cache (rc) - request-responses that were downloaded to local, but came from the remote-server cache.
     - `ro`: 25 from remote-origin (ro) - request-responses that were downloaded to local, and the download needed to be fetched from remote origin source.
     - `xx`: 1 failed responses - request-responses that failed (and successfully retried).
 - ~17GB downloaded in ~36 minutes (full dataset)
 - Approx ~414k hash values received per second
 - Processing in this example appears to be CPU bound, measured traffic around ~160 Mbit/s.
